# Telco Customer Churn Prediction
## Building and deploy a machine learning model for Churn prediction

Customer churn occurs when customers stop using a companyâ€™s services. So, by monitoring churn rate, companies become prepared and can develop personalied customer retention campaings.

Here, I use a machine learning to build a churn prediction model based on customer attributes from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn">Telco Customer dataset</a>. This dataset contains 7043 rows (customers) and 21 columns (features).

Also, the final model is deployed in production and can be tested <a href="https://telco-churn-app.herokuapp.com/">HERE<a/>. Just provide some data about a customer, and the system will point if is CHURN or NO CHURN.
The application platform used was Heroku.

The project is organized as follows:

```
